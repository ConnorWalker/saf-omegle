#summary Events to be handled

= Introduction =
This page documents the events that come from Omegle's servers and which may be processed by the event handler.  They should be handled with a function of the form `handler(self, chat, var)` where `handler` is the name of the function, `chat` is the `Omegle.OmegleChat` object that sent the event (and to which the handler is attached), and `var` is a list of supporting data.

= Table of Events =
This list will grow as I see more events.
